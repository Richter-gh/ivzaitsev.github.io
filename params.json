When generated, the system also solves the task and stores all its parameters in a database. Upon submitting his answer, the student immediately gets his result: right\\wrong, and his attempt at solving is stored in a database. Any user can get his own stats of solving attempts and appointed tasks.\r\n\r\nA user with admin privileges(i.e teacher) has access to the same things, plus 2 additional pages: another stats page, where any user can be selected and stats for this user will be displayed; and a page where he can select any task and it will be displayed with an answer.\r\n\r\nTester page example:\r\n<img src=\"images/beam-tester.png\" width=\"792\" height=\"744\" alt=\"\" />\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
